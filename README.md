# Bun + ElysiaJS + JSX (BEJ)

### This is not the end product, only a base from which to start developing API's

A small and dead simple web app based on an API Rest built using Bun and ElysiaJS that serves static pages with internalization without overhead.

Using Bun and Elysia's HTML plugin, it was possible to leverage the power of JSX as markup for the page templating.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
